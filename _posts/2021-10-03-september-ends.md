title: September ends - Weekly analysis
---

This week has been mostly bearish in many markets with an astronomical recovering on friday, specially on crypto and many indexes. 

## S&P500

S&P500 started the week rejecting $4455 daily support. That driven the price to $4332 daily support, but this support was broken on Thursday. This breaking off showed weakness (Also was were monthly candle closed this day). But on friday price has really nice recovering after tested $4278 4h-support on Futures, closing below $4366 daily resistance on futures this day.

Now we got the question: Was the downside breakout to 4332 daily support a fake breakout or S&P500 will continue plummeting? This question could be answered in this comming week, depending on how react to $4366 daily resistance.

I have 2 different scenarios, depending on which one could develop i will be bulish/bearish in some markets this week:

### 1.  Price rejects $4366 daily resistance

This could driven the price to lower levels between $4218 (1d-support)-$4165(Weekly support).

### 2.  Price do a upside breakout to $4366 daily resistance

This could give strength to S&P500 to reach a new ATH.

Hope S&P500 make a decision between Monday-Tuesday.

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin has been in range through the week, strictly respecting $40,5k daily support. Also on friday has done a very nice short squeeze that driven the price to $47,3k-$48,8k daily resistance levels. I only go long with bitcoin if S&P500 develops the second scenario. Else, price could go to test $43,5k daily support.

## DXY

Dollar is completly bullish now. Has done a clear upside breakout to $93.189 weekly resistance. I expect DXY to test $97,3 monthly resistance. There is a weekly support at $93,05 that have to respect if price wants to still be bulish

## XAUUSD

This was a good week to many commodities. Gold has a nice recoveral this week after test $1725 weekly support doing a nice bullish breakout. I expect gold to test $1797 daily resistance in the short term.

## Conclusion

Be patience and wait confirmation to which scenario will develop S&P500, because is well known that many markets are highly correlated to this index. Trade with caution this week if first scenario goes to the ring. 

Nice profits and nice week!
