title: Long USOIL 04/10/2021- Trade Analysis
---

Last 2 weeks I stayed bullish with USOIL. In 4h timeframe this commodity gives me an entry point (This while I was waiting for the bus to go home). 

So I noticed that the price went to test $73.32 per barrel 4h support respecting it. The next 4h-candle the price dramatically recovered, doing a upside breakout to $74.5 per barrel 4h-resistance. All of this in a short period of time (About 8 hours). Because of this, I waited for the pullback to the $74.5 4h-resistance broken and went long at this price.

My target was not at the sky because I became more conservative with USOIL. The reason is because the price is almost testing $80 monthly resistance, so i think $77.62 was a good target.

I setted a stop loss in $73.86 per barrel, with that I got a risk-reward ratio of 1:5 approximately.

### Conclusion

The trade was good. I could have setted my target at more high price because last week price hit the $80 monthly resistance but I prefered to stay conservative. For now I wait the reaction of USOIL at this $80 monthly resistance.
